I know that C is a high-level program. I've read up on it a little bit so I know
it was developed in the 1970's. C is a high level language which means it's easy for
humans to read and write. This would be in contrast to low-level language which are used
in computer hardware. C also require quite a lot of attention to detailm as small mistakes
have the ability to rended the code useless. Semi-colons are also used a lot more 
frequently then I'm used to. My most fluent language, Python, is object-oriented. 
Everythings an objct, which makes it easy to use but a very, very slow and memory 
consuming. I know C does not make everything an object automatically. This leve of 
precision allows for more efficient code which I know I'll enjoy.

I hope to learn from this course the building blocks of more commonly used programing 
languages like C++. C++ is obviously derived from C, and understanding how C works will 
grealty improve me as a developer. C also provide an entry way to low-level hardware
resources which is what makes it so efficient in the first place.

Now what concerns me about this course is quite a lot. My largest concern is the workload.
I've spent 7 hours this week on the reading alone, I'm not sure is Phil knows how long it really takes. I'm also concerned about the two weekly projects. I hope that they're 
smaller becasue that sounds intimidating at first glance. Again, I'm mostly concerned
about the reading. It's very thorough and extensive, it doesn't leave time for working 
on the projects. Since this is also his first time teaching this specific coure, I'm 
worried the workload will be too intense.

My future goals using CS skills after school is to enter the realm of cyber security or
coding for financial software/programs. I'm getting a minor in Economics, so I believe they'll go nicely together.
